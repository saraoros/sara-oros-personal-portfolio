# Welcome to Sara's personal portfolio

## Portfolio

Here is a one stop spot to learn more about myself, including my skills and my latest projects I've been working on. Be sure to check back regualrly to see updated projects.

## Challenge Goals:

- Sample previous work for potential employers to see
- Navigation and header should include the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- Links in the navigation should scroll to the corresponding section
- Links to the section about their work section should have titled images of the developer's applications.
- The first application should be larger in size than the others
- When the images of the applications are clicked, then they are taken to that deployed application
- The page is has a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport in any screensize
